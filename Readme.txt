# WGSOL
WG MatLab functions for PDE solving

WGSOL is a collection of MATLAB functions which implement the weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method in a simplified formulation (known as SWG â€“ Simplified Weak Galerkin) for numerical solving of PDEs in two dimensions. The current version contains SWG solvers for the Poisson equation, the convection-diffusion-reaction equation, and the Stokes equation.

Steps to follow for trying out the code:

1. Download the latest release version, unzip the file, and save the source code into your favorite folder, say ./WGSOL

2. Set path configuration: go to the underlying directory (e.g., ./WGSOL) 
   and run the file PathConfigure.m in MatLab.

3. In each subdirectory, .\Stokes, .\Poisson, .\Convection-diffusion, run the Main_*_swg.m file to test each solver. Read the header of the main file "Main*_swg.m" for setting new configurations (PDE data, domain, and partition options). In the main file, one can also set different values for the stablizer parameter, mesh types, etc.
