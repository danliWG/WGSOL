WGSOL: is a collection of MATLAB functions for weak Galerkin finite
element methods in two dimensions in a simplified formulation co-developed 
by Yujie Liu and Junping Wang. The Copyright (C) statements are specified 
in each code file.

The program package is based on the subroutines/functions developped in iFem by 
Dr. Long Chen: 

iFEM: an integrated finite element methods package in MATLAB, 
Technical Report, University of California at Irvine, 2008.

We would like to thank Dr. Chen for his code distribution which has greatly simplified
our work. All the subroutines/functions from iFEM are included in the subdirectory 
named "ifem_LongChen".
